        <h2 >Pros of Cryptocurrency</h2>
          <p> The overall appeal of this new technology is primarily the integrity and security. Benfits include user autonomy which ensures users more control
      of their currency unlike fiat currencies that are under an intermediary authority such as a bank or government. This would elimate things such as banking fees
            such as overdraft, minimum balance, deposit fees, and more. The currency is peer to peer focus making it very accessible. This means it will be easy for users
            to send and receive payments virtually to or from anywhere in the world. Also if you enjoy discretion a user may remain
      some what anonoymous because transaction addresses are changed with each successful process. There are a wide arrange of benfits of this new technology however
      with the good comes the bad.

    <h2>Cons of Cryptocurrency</h2>
        
         <div class="tablet-desk"><p>The primary drawback behind crypto would be its scalability. It has no essential cash flow which all successful businesses usually 
      thrive from. It also is unable to compete with the speed of transactions such as VISA. The cybersecurity behind the technology also looms its success.
      Since it is a digital currency it is subject to breaches and hacks. Along with the difficulty to trace the currency because of it's discretion it could lead to investors
      losing hundreds of millions of dollars. Also unlike the U.S. dollar which is backed by gold cryptocurrent has no inherent value. The overall flow could be thrown off considering the logistics as technology improves.
       Plus along with these issues the currency is decentralized; While some may see as a pro it has no regulations. This means that the federal government has no say. Some countries such as China went to the extent of banning the use of cryptocurrency.
           No supervision leads to a future that is difficult to predict.</p></div>
