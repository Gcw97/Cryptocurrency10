        <h2>How to Buy, Sell, and Invest</h2>
          <p> To purchase cryptocurrency you will need a wallet which falls into two categories which is hot and cold. A cold wallet is basically a flashdrive which can hold the currency phsyically 
      off the internet and is accessible via password. The opposite which is a hot wallet may be accessible via an online app. Some currencies such as Bitcoin may be purchased with U.S. dollars while others require you pay with bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency. The first
             step is to decide where to buy the currency in which you would need an exchange and traditional brokers. Apps like Robinhood or Coinbase is where you can get started investing.
             Once you make your purchase you must decide your overall plan to use the asset. Some choose to day trade while others choose to sit on the asset to watch it grow over time. When investing
             it's best to do your research different currencies have different values. Dogecoin value currently isn't worth no where close to a cent while one Bitcoin is currently as of date worth 32,743.91 U.S. dollars. Imagine 
           if you had just bought one Bitcoin in the summer of 2020 when it was about 7,000 dollars. Although the numbers look exciting one must remember that cryptocurrency is a very
          volatile market and as easily you can make money you can lose.
