        <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>

        <img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5bc662b786ecfc12c8d29e0b/5d07c76a696bfc4b3cb88294_cryptocurrency.jpg" class="image1">

          <p>Cryptocurrency AKA "crypto" is a digitcal currency that can be used to buy goods and services. This interesting technology was created by a user named "Satoshi Nakamato" which is actually a mysterious alias with no previous connections to one person.
            These currencies are usually company issued tokens which could be compared to casino chips or arcade tokens.
            It uses and online ledger with strong cryptography to secure online transactions. Cryptography is a method of protecting vital information and communications via the use of codes. This ensures that only those for whom the information was intended for may access it.
            In layman's terms a computers uses algorithims to transforms messages to where the are very difficult to decipher. Once the message reaches it's destination it is descrambled using various techniques.
            Cryptocurrency uses a decentralized technology called a blockchain that is spread across various computers that manages and records transactions. The top 10 crpytocurrencies currently on the market are Bitcoin,
            Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Cardano, Polkadot, and Binance Coin.

        <p id="whitepaper"> The Bitcoin whitepaper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, was published in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.
          Bitcoin is revolutionizing the global payments industry and people around the world are rethinking the meaning of their money. Moreover, the underlying technology and network that process Bitcoin transactions, known as blockchain, is transforming industries as varied as banking, farming, logistics, healthcare, elections and manufacturing, to name a few. 
          All this is made possible by Satoshi Nakamoto's groundbreaking work published in 2008 which outlines what Bitcoin is and how it works, as presented in the original Bitcoin whitepaper.

    The Bitcoin whitepaper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, was published in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.
     Bitcoin is revolutionizing the global payments industry and people around the world are rethinking the meaning of their money.

  <p> The electronic transaction process, namely the blockchain, gets technical. In simple terms, Satoshi defines an electronic "coin" as a chain of digital signatures.
     Owners digitally sign a hash of the previous transaction and add a public key of the next owner to the end of the coin. 
     A recipient of the coin, a payee, can verify the signatures in order to verify the chain of ownership.</p>
 <p>

  A timestamp server takes a hash of a block of items and publicly announces the hash. The timestamp proves the existence of the data at the time. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash. 
  And each additional timestamp reinforces the ones before it.
   This sequence forms a chain.
 </p>

<p>
  The peer-to-peer system for electronic payments relies on a distributed network of honest nodes to validate transactions. 
  Validation replaces the need to trust expensive third parties such as banks. The electronic coins are made from digital signatures, and proof-of-work that form the blockchain prevent double-spending. 
  The system stays secure so long as honest nodes control more CPU power than an attacker. Moreover, the nodes accept longer blocks as valid and work on extending them. This protocol rejects invalid blocks, and potential fraud, in the process. 
  Rules and incentives can be enforced using a voting system.
